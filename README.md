My name is Haozhe (Herman) An. I'm currently a research intern in Big Data Lab at Baidu, Inc in Beijing, China.

I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from University of California, San Diego with Summa Magna Cum (GPA: 3.987/4.0) in 2019. I have braod research interests in deep learning and theoretical computer science.

## Research Experience
### Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence 
My very first research experience was about Natural Language Processing (NLP) in BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. I worked on a project about disease diagnosis in healthcare services under the guidance of Mr. Xingjian Li. This experience sparked my interests in further exploring NLP.

I worked on another NLP project with two classmates. We used a RNN model and developed a [Haiku Generator](https://github.com/haozhe-an/Haiku_Generator) that is able to generate a complete Haiku that rhymes. If you aren't familair with Haiku, it is a Japanese style short poem with several rules restricting its strcture. The presentation slides for the project is available [here](https://github.com/haozhe-an/Haiku_Generator/blob/master/lign167_presentation.pptx).

I was fortunate to spend my summer at Colorado School of Mines as a research assistant in [Dr. Xiaoli Zhang's lab](http://xzhanglab.mines.edu/). I contributed to a Human-Robot Interatction project by carrying out an experiment and analyzing its results. I also learned about [transfer learning](https://github.com/haozhe-an/Transfer_Learning_CDM).

I'm now working at the Big Data Lab at Baidu, Inc with Mr. Xingjian Li again. My current project is about model compression and transfer learning.

### Theoretical Computer Science
From a theory class taught by [Dr. Mia Minnes](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/) in UC San Diego, I found myself to be deeply interested in theoretical computer science. I love algorithm designs, theory of computation and cryptography. 

It was a very rewarding experience to do research in Fine-grained Complexity and Algorithm Design under [Dr. Russell Impagliazzo](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/)'s supervision. I was part of a reasearch group of four. I was supported by UC Scholars Program for the duration of the research. Slides for my presentation in Summer Research Conference at UC San Diego are available [here](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/Hc1Jnnw5Wpx1vp).

Hypotheses arouse my curiosity because they are open questions that contain limitless possibilities. Theories fulfill my curiosity because they tell us what is possible to achieve and what is not. It would be indeed amazing if I could turn a hypothesis to a theory some time soon. 

### Intersection of AI and Theoretical Computer Science?
Perhaps we should develop more theories that explain why a neural network works.

These theories would allow computers to study well so as to pass the Turing test.

## Tutoring
I admire people who consistently inspire others through teaching. I wish I could be like them some day by becoming a great teacher. I was fortunate to be an undergraduate tutor to assist professors in various courses. My role is mainly to answer students' questions in tutor hours, grade homework assignments, proofread course materials and offer suggestions for improvement, and promote student interactions in lectures. I have tutored the follwoing courses:

- CSE 8A - Intro to Computer Science: Java (I) with [Dr. Mia Minnes](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/) and [Dr. Joe Politz](https://jpolitz.github.io/)
- CSE 12 - Data Structures and OO Programming with Dr. Philip Papadopoulos
- CSE 20 - Discrete Math for CS with [Dr. Mia Minnes](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/) and [Dr. Joe Politz](https://jpolitz.github.io/)
- CSE 105 - Theory of Computation with [Dr. Mia Minnes](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/)

(Yes, Dr. Mia Minnes is my favorite professor in UC San Diego and I enjoyed to be her tutor very, very, very much. One 'very' for each time tutoring for her!)

## Honors and Awards
- Singapore SM1 School-based Scholarship (2011 - 2015)
- [Max Planck Society Travel Fellowship](https://cmmrs2018.mpi-sws.org/) (2018)
- Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society (2018 - present)
- [UC Scholars Program Award](https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/uc-scholars/index.html) (2019)
- Phi Beta Kappa Society (2019 - present)

## Life is more enjoyable with...
### Traveling 
I love traveling to different places with my family and friends. There are uncountable elements in these trips that make them memorable: The unforgettable experience of seeing an amazing and unique glacier landscape in El Calafate, Argentina, the fun conversations with people from all over the world in the desert of Morocco, the stupid and embarrassing cultural mistakes I have commited while transiting in Netherlands, the scrumptious Ichiran ramen I had multiple times with my Singaporean friends...

I was at Potato Chip Rock in San Diego!

I also enjoy having road trips! It was a great experience driving along Route 66 from Chicago all the way to Los Angeles with my greatest clique ever. Drving from San Francisco to Los Angeles on California State 1 with some of my best high school friends was another awesome trip.

One really important thing: Thanks to my parents who have been generously supporting me to travel around the world and open my eyes!

I have visited:
- China (Of course! I'm from here.)
- Singapore
- Malaysia
- Indonesia
- Japan
- Brazil
- Argentina
- Mexico 
- Ecuador
- The United States
- Germany
- Austria
- Morocco
