My name is Haozhe (Herman) An. I'm currently a research intern at Baidu Research in Beijing, China.

I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from University of California, San Diego with Summa Magna Cum (GPA: 3.987/4.0) in 2019. I am interested in theoretical computer science.

## Research Experience
From a theory class taught by [Dr. Mia Minnes](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/) in UC San Diego, I found myself to be deeply interested in theoretical computer science. I love algorithm designs, theory of computation and cryptography. 

It was a very rewarding experience to do research in Fine-grained Complexity and Algorithm Design under [Dr. Russell Impagliazzo](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/)'s supervision. I was part of a reasearch group of four. I was supported by UC Scholars Program for the duration of the research. Slides for my presentation in Summer Research Conference at UC San Diego are available [here](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/Hc1Jnnw5Wpx1vp).

Hypotheses arouse my curiosity because they are open questions that contain limitless possibilities. Theories fulfill my curiosity because they tell us what is possible to achieve and what is not. It would be indeed amazing if I could turn a hypothesis to a theory some time soon. 

## Tutoring
I admire people who consistently inspire others through teaching. I wish I could be like them some day by becoming a great teacher. I was fortunate to be an undergraduate tutor to assist professors in various courses. My role is mainly to answer students' questions in tutor hours, grade homework assignments, proofread course materials and offer suggestions for improvement, and promote student interactions in lectures. I have tutored the following courses:

- CSE 8A - Intro to Computer Science: Java (I) with [Dr. Mia Minnes](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/) and [Dr. Joe Politz](https://jpolitz.github.io/)
- CSE 12 - Data Structures and OO Programming with Dr. Philip Papadopoulos
- CSE 20 - Discrete Math for CS with [Dr. Mia Minnes](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/) and [Dr. Joe Politz](https://jpolitz.github.io/)
- CSE 105 - Theory of Computation with [Dr. Mia Minnes](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/)

(Yes, Dr. Mia Minnes is my favorite professor in UC San Diego and I enjoyed to be her tutor very, very, very much. One 'very' for each time tutoring for her!)

## Life is more enjoyable with...
### Traveling 
I love traveling to different places with my family and friends. There are uncountable elements in these trips that make them memorable: The unforgettable experience of seeing an amazing and unique glacier landscape in El Calafate, Argentina, the fun conversations with people from all over the world in the desert of Morocco, the stupid and embarrassing cultural mistakes I have commited while transiting in Netherlands, the scrumptious Ichiran ramen I had multiple times with my Singaporean friends...

I was at Potato Chip Rock in San Diego!

I also enjoy having road trips! It was a great experience driving along Route 66 from Chicago all the way to Los Angeles with my greatest clique ever. Drving from San Francisco to Los Angeles on California State 1 with some of my best high school friends was another awesome trip.

One really important thing: Thanks to my parents who have been generously supporting me to travel around the world and open my eyes!

Here is a map of the countries that I have visited.

I have visited:
China (Of course - I'm from here), Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, United States, Germany, Austria, Morocco
